# Daily Exercises - Module 2: Working with Branches

**Objective:** Practice creating, switching, and merging branches in Git.

**Instructions:** Continue working in your `my-first-project` repository from Module 1.

1.  **Create a New Feature Branch:**

    - Create a new branch named `feature-styling` to work on the website's styling.
    - Switch to this new branch.

2.  **Make Changes on the Feature Branch:**

    - Edit the `style.css` file to add some basic styles (e.g., background color, font).
    - Stage and commit these changes with a message like "Added basic styling".

3.  **Switch Back to the Main Branch:**

    - Switch back to the `main` branch.

4.  **Make Different Changes on the Main Branch:**

    - Edit the `index.html` file to add a new paragraph.
    - Stage and commit this change with a message like "Added a new paragraph to index.html".

5.  **Merge the Feature Branch:**

    - Merge the `feature-styling` branch into the `main` branch. What happens automatically?

6.  **Simulate a Conflict (Optional):**

    - If the merge in step 5 was a fast-forward (no conflict), go back to the `feature-styling` branch, modify `index.html` in a way that will conflict with the change you made on `main`, commit it, and then try merging again. Resolve the conflict.

7.  **Delete the Feature Branch:**
    - Once the `feature-styling` branch is merged, delete it.

**Review:** Reflect on the process of creating, switching, and merging branches. Understand how Git handles these operations and how to resolve conflicts.
