# Daily Exercises - Module 1: Introduction to Version Control and Git

**Objective:** Reinforce your understanding of basic Git concepts and commands covered in Module 1.

**Instructions:** Complete these exercises in your local Git repository.

1.  **Initialize a New Project:**

    - Create a new directory named `my-first-project`.
    - Navigate into this directory in your terminal.
    - Initialize a Git repository here using the appropriate command.

2.  **Track Initial Files:**

    - Create three new text files inside `my-first-project`: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. Add some basic content to each file (e.g., a simple HTML structure in `index.html`).
    - Use the appropriate Git command to add all these files to the staging area.

3.  **Commit Your Changes:**

    - Commit the staged files with a clear and concise message, such as "Initial commit: Basic website structure".

4.  **Check Repository Status:**

    - Use the command to check the current status of your Git repository. What does it tell you?

5.  **View Commit History:**

    - Display the commit history of your repository. You should see the commit you just made. Try using different options (e.g., `--oneline`, `--graph`) to view the history in different formats.

6.  **Ignore Temporary Files:**

    - Create a new file named `.DS_Store` (common on macOS) in your `my-first-project` directory.
    - Create a `.gitignore` file and add `.DS_Store` to it.
    - Check the status of your repository again. Is `.DS_Store` being tracked? Why or why not?

7.  **Make Further Changes and Commit:**
    - Edit one of your files (e.g., add a heading to `index.html`).
    - Stage only this modified file.
    - Commit this change with a message like "Added a heading to index.html".

**Review:** After completing these exercises, review the commands you used and the concepts they represent. Make sure you understand each step.
