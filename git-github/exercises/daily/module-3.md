# Daily Exercises - Module 3: Remote Repositories and GitHub

**Objective:** Practice working with remote repositories on GitHub.

**Prerequisites:** You should have a GitHub account and a local Git repository with at least one commit.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Create a Repository on GitHub:**

    - Go to the GitHub website and create a new repository named `my-first-project-remote`. Make it public or private as you prefer. Do not initialize it with a README, license, or `.gitignore` (we'll handle that locally).

2.  **Connect Local to Remote:**

    - In your local `my-first-project` repository, add the GitHub repository as a remote. Use the `git remote add` command. You'll need the URL of your GitHub repository.

3.  **Push to GitHub:**

    - Push your local `main` branch to the remote repository on GitHub.

4.  **Make a Change on GitHub:**

    - On the GitHub website, navigate to your `my-first-project-remote` repository.
    - Edit one of the files (e.g., `index.html`) directly through the GitHub interface. Make a small change and commit it.

5.  **Pull Changes Locally:**

    - Back in your local `my-first-project` repository, use the command to pull the changes you made on GitHub down to your local machine.

6.  **Explore Branches on GitHub:**
    - Create a new branch on GitHub (e.g., `feature-github-edit`).
    - Back in your local repository, fetch the list of branches from the remote repository.
    - Checkout the `feature-github-edit` branch locally.

**Review:** Understand the flow of pushing local changes to GitHub and pulling remote changes to your local machine. Familiarize yourself with basic GitHub interface for repository management.
