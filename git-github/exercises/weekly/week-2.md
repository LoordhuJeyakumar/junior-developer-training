# Weekly Exercises - Week 2: Collaboration with GitHub

**Objective:** Practice working with remote repositories, collaboration, and Pull Requests on GitHub.

**Scenario:** You are now ready to host your `task-manager` project on GitHub and collaborate with a (simulated) team member.

**Prerequisites:** You need a GitHub account and the local `task-manager` repository from Week 1.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Create Remote Repository:** Create a new private repository named `task-manager` on GitHub.
2.  **Connect Local to Remote:** Add the GitHub repository as a remote to your local `task-manager` repository.
3.  **Push to GitHub:** Push your local `main` branch to the remote repository.
4.  **Simulate Collaboration (Branching and PR):**
    - Create a new branch named `feature-sorting` in your local repository.
    - Make some changes in this branch (e.g., add a button to sort tasks in `index.html` and some basic JavaScript in `script.js`).
    - Commit your changes and push the `feature-sorting` branch to your remote repository on GitHub.
    - On GitHub, create a Pull Request from the `feature-sorting` branch to the `main` branch.
    - (Simulate a code review) Add a comment to your Pull Request suggesting a change.
    - Make the suggested change in your local `feature-sorting` branch, commit it, and push it to GitHub. The Pull Request should automatically update.
    - (Simulate merging) Merge the Pull Request on GitHub into the `main` branch.
5.  **Pull Changes:**
    - Switch back to your local `main` branch and pull the changes you made on GitHub (including the merged feature) to your local repository.
6.  **Explore Issues:**
    - On GitHub, create a new Issue for a bug you've noticed in your application.
    - Assign the issue to yourself.
    - Create a new branch locally to fix this bug (e.g., `fix-task-display`).
    - Make the necessary changes to fix the bug, commit them, and push the branch to GitHub.
    - Create a Pull Request to merge the fix into `main`.
    - Merge the Pull Request and close the Issue.

**Review:** This week, you should have gained experience in setting up remote repositories, pushing and pulling changes, using branches for collaboration, and understanding the Pull Request workflow on GitHub.
