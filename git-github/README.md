# Git and GitHub Training for Junior Developers

**Welcome to the Git and GitHub training module!**

This section of the Junior Developer Training Program is designed to equip you with the fundamental skills to effectively use Git for version control and GitHub for collaborative software development. Mastering these tools is essential for any modern software developer, enabling you to track changes to your code, collaborate seamlessly with others, and contribute to projects of any size.

## Module Overview

This module is broken down into several key modules, each focusing on specific aspects of Git and GitHub. By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the core concepts of version control and why it's important.
- Install and configure Git on your local machine.
- Perform basic Git operations such as initializing repositories, staging changes, and committing.
- Effectively use branching to manage different lines of development.
- Merge branches and resolve conflicts that may arise.
- Understand the fundamentals of GitHub as a platform for hosting Git repositories.
- Create and manage repositories on GitHub.
- Connect your local Git repository to a remote repository on GitHub.
- Collaborate with others using GitHub's features like Issues and Pull Requests.
- Understand basic branching strategies for team collaboration.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- **Basic computer literacy:** Familiarity with using a computer, navigating files and folders, and using a text editor.
- **Command Line Basics (Recommended):** While not strictly required initially, a basic understanding of how to use the command line or terminal will be beneficial, especially as we delve deeper into Git.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the concept of version control and its benefits.
- Install and configure Git on your development machine.
- Create a new Git repository for a project.
- Track changes to files using Git's staging area and commits.
- View the history of changes in a Git repository.
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude specific files from version control.
- Create, switch between, and manage Git branches.
- Merge changes from one branch into another.
- Identify and resolve merge conflicts.
- Create and manage repositories on GitHub.
- Connect a local Git repository to a remote GitHub repository.
- Push local changes to GitHub and pull changes from GitHub.
- Use GitHub Issues for task tracking and bug reporting.
- Understand and participate in the Pull Request workflow for code review and collaboration.
- Understand the basics of different branching strategies used in team environments.

## How to Use This Material

This module is structured into lessons. We recommend going through the lessons in the order they are presented. Each lesson will typically include:

- **Explanation of concepts:** Clear and concise explanations of the topic at hand.
- **Code examples:** Practical examples of Git commands and their usage.
- **Hands-on exercises:** Tasks for you to perform to reinforce your understanding.
- **Real-world scenarios:** Examples of how these concepts are applied in actual development workflows.

Make sure to actively participate in the exercises and try out the commands yourself. This hands-on experience is crucial for truly understanding and retaining the information.
